# Sentiment Value Project Open-Ended

For this, I decided to demonstrate the open-ended assignments on the Sentiment Value lab as simply as possible.

I called a function, then used nested if statements, then iterated through a loop. I also took advantage of substrings and array/string lengths.

The main section of the project is here: https://github.com/FrankTCA/SentimentValueProject
